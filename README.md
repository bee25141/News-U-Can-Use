# News-U-Can-Use
Interactive News Scraper Web App <br/>

News U Can Use is an interactive web scraper app that pulls headlines and links from the Reddit News webpage. Users can click on the headlines they find interesting and add comments to the headlines. The scraped headlines and comments are stored in a MongoDB database and presented to users upon page load. The web app currently has very basic functionality and design; next steps are to enhance the design layout of the news headlines and notes, incorporate news summaries, and add improved functionality to scrape multiple news sites of the user's choice.
